    <h1>The Secret of Vietnamese Coffee</h1>

    <p> The preparation process, as well as the blend of beans, helps give Vietnamese coffee its particular style.
         Most of the Vietnamese coffee bean plantations are located in the area of <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/vietnam/dalat"> Da lat</a>, 
         nicely nicknamed 'Europe of Vietnam' because of its fresher climate and hilly landscape. 
         Most of the tea, coffee and even the flowers sold across the country 
         are originally grown there in the south. </p>
         
         <br>
    
    <p> But what makes Vietnamese coffee so flavourful? 
        Some will argue it's the filter drip, but the traditional roasting way 
        actually makes for its special intense taste: the Vietnamese can roast it with rice wine, 
        a pinch of salt, and butter. This last ingredient is the reason why slow-drip coffee in Vietnam 
        can sport a slight oily texture. Some roasteries add flavours such as chocolate or caramel, 
        all very much to the taste of local coffee drinkers. </p>
        
        <br>
    
    <p>Coarsely ground beans go into a French drip filter (called a phin), 
        which sits on top of the cup. The beans are weighted down with a thin lid, 
        hot water is added to the phin, and then the water slowly trickles through into the cup. 
        This operation should be repeated at least twice before the drip actually produces enough coffee to be enjoyed.</p>
